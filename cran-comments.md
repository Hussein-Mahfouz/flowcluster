## Previous submission NOTEs
This resubmission addresses all NOTEs from the prior submission:

1. The `License` field in DESCRIPTION is now `MIT + file LICENSE` as required for template licenses.
2.  The `README_files` directory has been added to `.Rbuildignore`.
3.  An `inst/WORDLIST` file has been added to address the spelling false positive.
4.  Regarding the URL check NOTE (`Could not resolve hostname`): I have confirmed the URL is correct and publicly accessible. This appears to have been a transient network issue during the last check.

Thank you for your consideration.
