## Resubmission

This is a resubmission of flowcluster. The previous version was 0.2.0.

I have addressed the NOTEs from the previous review:

* **Misspelled words in DESCRIPTION**: I have corrected the typo ("delineating") and added "et" and "al" to an `inst/WORDLIST` file to prevent false positives.

* **Invalid URL in DESCRIPTION**: I have confirmed that the GitHub Pages URL is correct and the site is active and accessible.

* **Long-running example**: I have significantly simplified the example for `aggregate_clustered_flows()` to ensure it runs in under 5 seconds, which resolves this NOTE. The original, more detailed workflow is now included in a `\dontrun{}` block for user reference.

## R CMD check results

There were 0 ERRORs, 0 WARNINGs, and 0 NOTEs.
