1.  Create distance matrix between OD pairs
2.  Pass distance matrix to a clustering algorithm

The goal of flowcluster is to provide functions and example datasets for
clustering OD origin-destination datasets. This process can be useful
for visualising large OD datasets and analysing patterns in the data.

``` bash
# see if the workflows are working:
gh run list
```

Install the package with:

``` r
if (!requireNamespace("pak", quietly = TRUE)) {
  install.packages("pak")
}
pak::pkg_install("Hussein-Mahfouz/flowcluster")
```

Or, for local development, clone the repo, open the project in RStudio,
and run:

``` r
devtools::load_all()
#> â„¹ Loading flowcluster
```
