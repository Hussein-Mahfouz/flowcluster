	abstract = {Investment in Demand-Responsive Transport ({DRT}) has emerged as a sustainable transport intervention option for areas that are traditionally hard to serve by high frequency public transport. When used as a first- and last-mile feeder, {DRT} has the potential to reduce car dependency and enhance access to the wider network. However, many {DRT} schemes fail—often due to overly flexible, poorly targeted service areas that do not align with actual travel patterns, making efficient pooling difficult. While planners may already have a general sense of where {DRT} might be useful, there is limited guidance on how to identify precise operating zones based on spatiotemporal demand. This paper presents a method for identifying potential {DRT} service areas using spatial clustering of origin–destination ({OD}) flows. We apply the method in Leeds, {UK}, focusing on {OD} pairs with poor public transport supply and low potential demand. The approach identifies spatial clusters where demand is both underserved and sufficiently concentrated to support {DRT} operation. By narrowing service areas to zones where pooling is more likely and where {DRT} complements rather than competes with fixed-route services, the method helps address two key challenges in {DRT} planning. The results offer a reproducible, data-driven input for delineating preliminary {DRT} service areas—supporting strategic planning, integration with downstream agent-based models, and further refinement through local knowledge. The method provides a foundation for future work on designing {DRT} services that complement the public transport network, particularly in low-density urban peripheries.},
